    1. What is Semantic HTML? 
        It's HTML that gives meaning to our markup
    2. What is HTML used for? 
        It's used for the structure of our website
    3. What is an attribute and where do we put it? 
        Attributes provide us a way to add additional data to an HTML element - they are included within the opening/start tag of the element
    4. What is the h1 tag used for? How many times should I use it on a page?
        Used to indicate the heading of our website - should ideally only be used once per page, but technically it can be used multiple times if implemented correctly according to browser standards 
    5. Name two tags that have required attributes
        - `a` tag requires the `href` attribute 
        - `img` tag requires the `alt` attribute 
    6. What do we put in the head of our HTML document? 
        Metadata for our document, e.g. links to our CSS resources
    7. What is an id? 
        Unique identifier attribute for an HTML element
    8. What elements can I add an id to? 
        Any HTML element
    9. How many times can I use the same id on a page? 
        Only once
    10. What is a class? 
        An attribute that gives an element a class name that can be referenced later for styling/js purposes
    11. What elements can I add a class to?

        As many as needed/desired 
    13. How do I get my link to open in a new tab?
        Add `target="_blank"` attribute to your opening `a` tag like so: `<a href="#" target="_blank">`
    14. What is the alt attribute in the image tag used for? 
        Used primarily for accessibility purposes - it is the alternate text for an `img` element incase the image cannot be displayed or for screen readers - should adequately describe the image
    15. How do I reference an id?
        In CSS: using the `#` sign and then the id name - e.g. `#idName`
    16. What is the difference between a section and a div
        A `section` element 'groups' its child elements, whereas the div element does not carry any meaning when it comes to HTML outlines
    17. What is CSS used for?
        Styling
    18. How to we select an element? Example - every h2 on the page
        In CSS: just by the element's tag name - e.g `h2`
    19. What is the difference between a class and an id? - Give me an example of when I might use each one
        Class names can be used multiple times, whereas an id name can only be used once
            - class: assign an element a class name to use as a selector in our CSS file and add styling, then on another element that requires the same styling properties add that class name as well
            - id: use an id to give an element a unique identifier that you can later reference in a CSS or JS file - in CSS the id selector has a higher specificity 
    20. How do we select classes in CSS?
        By adding a `.` in front of the class name - e.g. `.className`
    21. How do we select a p element with a single class of “human””?
        In CSS: `p.human`
    22. What is a parent child selector? When would this be useful? 
        Adding a `>` character in between the CSS selector for the parent & child - e.g. `.parentClassName > .childClassName` - this is useful for specificity purposes & organization
    23. How do you select all links within a div with the class of sidebar?
        In CSS: `div.sidebar a`
    24. What is a pseudo selector?

        `ls`
    33. How do I remove a file via the command line? Why do I have to be careful with this? 
        `rm fileName` - need to be careful because most terminals won't prompt you to confirm
    34. Why should I use version control? 
        To keep track of, and document, changes to your projects and prevent code conflicts when working with a team
    35. How often should I commit to github?
        Each time you complete a specific task (or roughly every 20 min if changes are actively being made)
    36. What is the command we would use to push our repo up to github? 
        `git push -u origin branch-name`
    37. Walk me through Lambda's git flow. 
        1. Fork the remote repo in github
        2. Clone the repo onto your machine
            - In your terminal, `cd` into the directory you want to save your repo in then run `git clone link-to-repo`
        3. Create a new branch with the following naming syntax `firstName-lastName`
            - In your terminal, `cd` into the repository then run `git checkout -b "firstName-LastName"`
        4. Make your code changes in VSCode & commit your changes to that branch
            - `git status` - check for changes
            - `git add .` - stage all changes
            - `git commit -m "message describing the changes in your commit"`
        5. Push changes up to your remote repo
            - `git push -u origin firstName-lastName` 
        6. In github, open a pull request from your `firstName-lastName` branch into `master` - ensure that you are on your forked version of the repo
